A cross-platform command line tool for parallelized, distributed content-extraction. Built on top of [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) and an essential part of the engineering behind the [Panama Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers), [Swiss Leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Leaks) and [Luxembourg Leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg_Leaks) investigations.

It supports Redis-backed queueing for distributed, parallel extraction and will write to Solr, plain text files or standard output.

For guidance and instructions, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ICIJ/extract/wiki).
