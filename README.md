# Extract #

A cross-platform command line tool for content analysis. Built on top of [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/).

Extract streams the output from Tika instead of bufferring it all into memory before writing. This allows it to operate on very large files without memory issues.

## Compiling ##

Requires [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and Maven:

```bash
cd extract/
mvn install
```

The executables are packaged using [Capsule](https://github.com/puniverse/capsule). Look in `target/` for the appropriate executable for your platform.
