# Extract

A cross-platform command line tool for parallelized, distributed content-extraction. Built on top of [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) and an essential part of the engineering behind the [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/blog/20160425-data-tech-team-ICIJ.html) investigation.

It supports Redis-backed queueing for distributed extraction and will write to Solr, plain text files or standard output.

For guidance and instructions, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ICIJ/extract/wiki).
