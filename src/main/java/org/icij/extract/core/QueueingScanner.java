/**
 * An implementation of {@link Scanner} which pushes encountered file paths into a

 * when a space becomes available.
 *
 * A buffer size may be specified in the constructor, in which case a separate
 * thread will be used to drain to the queue when it is close to capacity.
 *
 * In both cases, this implementation is thread-safe.
